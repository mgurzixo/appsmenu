0.3.1

Fixed:
- After printing the help message, the script won't exit. Now a `-h`
  switch is added, and the script will exit after help message.
- A possible rare case, where a svg path in desktop entry, the saved png
  paths might conflict if more than one svg paths have same basename. #4


0.3.0 2021-09-16

Added:
- `-f` option to force caching icons even if already cached. Useful when
  switching to a new icon theme, or the icon theme get updated.
- `-n` option to skip icon caching, a.k.a. dry run mode.

Changes:
- Png and xpm icon images are not copied to cache directory anymore.
  Their original path will be used in the generated menu.
  This could bring some speed compromising, since the icons will be
  searched every time.
- Use `gtk-query-settings` command to get default icon theme, instead of
  parsing settings.ini file of gtk3.
  If this command is unavailable and an icon theme is not specified
  explicitly, "Adwaita" will be used.
- The extension (for now, svg) won't be stripped in the generated cache
  image, i.e., icon.svg will be cached to icon.svg.png instead of icon.png.
