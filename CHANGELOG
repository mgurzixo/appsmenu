# C version

This current version of xdg-xmenu is written in C, before which there was a
Python version and a shell version (see below for their history versions).
The options are different between different variations, so modify your command
after installing a new one.

This C version can run really fast (e.g., about 10 to 20 ms on my machine) so
that one can directly start xmenu with it. In contrast, a user certainly had to
export the menu to a file first and then feed the menu to xmenu later, if he is
using the shell version.

Fixed:
- Check vadidation of the app's desktop file, #12

v1.0.0-beta.1 2022-10-28

# Python version

Below is the legacy Python version. Later C version will not be backward
compatible with this in terms of cli interface. Although I will try to
make most the options the same.

The python versions are just intermediate state of this program, which I never
introduced to anyone. I wrote the C version right after this. Please use that
instead.
